<!-- ## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ntung88/ntung.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ntung88/ntung.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## Proposals
For a better understanding of the things I am interested in and working on now...

[Honors Thesis: Concentration Inequalities for the Median (and why they matter)]

[A Graph Theoretic Approach to Multiscale Functional Connectivity Estimation](Tung%2CNathan_ResearchProposal.pdf)

## Code
Unfortunately much of my work lives in private repos...

[Neuro-Hotnet](https://github.com/ntung88/NeuroHotnet)

All the R code for the algorithms in Neuro-Hotnet and running experiments.

[Trading Algorithms](https://github.com/ntung88/Trading_Algorithms)

Just messing around with some algorithmic trading strategies in Python, mostly as an intellectual exercise.
