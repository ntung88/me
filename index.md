<!-- ## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ntung88/ntung.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ntung88/ntung.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## Code
Unfortunately much of my work lives in private repos...

[Neuro-Hotnet](https://github.com/ntung88/NeuroHotnet)

All the R code for the algorithms in Neuro-Hotnet and running experiments. Mostly written myself except code from Higgins et al.'s 2018 paper.

[Dynamical Movement Primitives](https://github.com/babbatem/skills_kin)

Code I modified for RL research on chaining Dynamical Movement Primitives using soft actor-critic to learn robust motor skills.

[Citadel/Correlation One East Coast Regional Data Open](https://github.com/dashamet/east-coast-datathon)

Creation of a novel diversity index for films that won 1st and $20k. Statistical analysis done on provided data as well as data obtained from computer vision on film posters to extract demographics of the depicted cast. I personally wrote the computer vision and poster scraping code.

[Trading Algorithms](https://github.com/ntung88/Trading_Algorithms)

Just messing around with some algorithmic trading strategies in Python, mostly as an intellectual exercise.

[Solo](https://github.com/ntung88/Solo)

Rudimentary beginnings of an app to help plan nights out featuring live ratings of venues/events, a map interface, and snapchat synchronization.

[Tron](https://github.com/ntung88/Tron)

Python code for an AI to play light bike (Tron).
